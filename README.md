## Introduction

## Part-1 : UNET implementation with different varient
### Implementation-1 : Max-Pooling for reduction, Transpose-Convolution for upscaling and Binary-Cross-Entropy for loss calculation
### Implementation-2 : Max-Pooling for reduction, Transpose-Convolution for upscaling and Dice loss for loss calculation
### Implementation-3 : Strided-Convolution for reduction, Transpose-Convolution for upscaling and Binary-Cross-Entropy for loss
### Implementation-4 : Strided-Convolution for reduction, Transpose-Convolution for upscaling and Dice loss
### Implementation-5 : Strided-Convolution for reduction, `nn.UpSample` for upscaling and Dice loss
### Implementation-6 : Strided-Convolution for reduction, `nn.UpSample` for upscaling and Binary-Cross-Entropy + Dice loss
